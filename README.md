# SeizureDetect-FS: Seizure Detection Enhancement with Feature Selection and Segmentation

## Overview

SeizureDetect-FS aims to advance seizure detection methodologies by integrating feature selection and data segmentation. This **computional intelligance** project emphasizes the improvement of accuracy and processing speed for seizure detection models through meticulous feature evaluation, selection, and strategic data segmentation.

## Components

### Feature Evaluation and Selection

- **Feature Evaluation**: Utilizes decision tree classifiers to assess individual feature effectiveness.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines feature interrelations to identify minimally correlated attributes.
- **Feature Selection**: Employs findings from evaluation and analysis to select optimal features for the model.

### Accuracy Improvement through Segmentation

- **Data Segmentation**: Segregates the dataset into smaller, manageable segments.
- **Model Training**: Applies segment-specific training to enhance model precision and efficiency.
- **Unique Diagnostic System**: Integrates multiple subsystems for a comprehensive seizure diagnosis approach.

### Model Evaluation

- Tests the model across different classification modes (e.g., 2-class, 3-class) to verify versatility and robustness.
